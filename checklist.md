 
 ## Getting the files into the right state for the exercise
 * edit roster to include class names
 * invite people to be collaborators ./gcrw invite
 * generate solo files ./gcrw files
 * have them clone the repo
 * generate conflict ./gcrw files --conflict

 if you need to delete it is ./gcrw files --delete but it deletes all.

##
* make a change to the author line in your solo file
* git add and commit it to your local repository
* try to push your version to origin
* should fail, read the errror
* if appropriate, use pull to get the new work as part of  your local repository
* read the messages
* as appropriate edit the conflicts identified to resolve the conflict
* add and commit your solution to your local repository
* push your resolution to the remote for everyone to pick up as they pull
